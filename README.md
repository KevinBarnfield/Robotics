# Robotics
  For my work relating to robotics, whether it's personal projects or ones I have worked on with the UOGUELPH Robotics Team.

### Projects

#### Platform Bot
  * A left over robot from previous team members. The goal is to get it driving with a Raspberry Pi and PS4 controller. Also would like a video feed to be sent back to PC.

#### Zumo Bot
  * We did not end up finishing the code for these bots. The ping sensor's code is completely commented out.

### Reusing Code
You are free to reuse code in this repository unless otherwise mentioned in that project's README. Most of the projects stored in here are quite small and the code may not be organized well.
